i am a 17 year old student
who is learning to code in python.
I am currently learning DSA and creating mini projects..

I have also created a TicTacToe game.

I have also created a ToDoList project that allows users to add, view, and mark tasks as complete.

I have also made a Weather App that uses the weatherAPI to fetch and display the weather of a city.

I have also created a Gemini Chatbot that can use tools like image generation, TicTacToe, ToDoList, and Weather App to give a better response.

I also followed tutorials to create a social media app clone. Furthermore, I attempted to build a YouTube clone independently, with occasional assistance from ChatGPT. It's important to note that for both clones, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aspects were pre-built, and I am currently focusing on learning these front-end technologies.

Regarding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I have been learning and implementing concepts such as Binary Search, Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Sliding Window techniques, and various Sorting algorithms.
