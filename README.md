## MERN Stack Learning

This section showcases my journey in learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes projects built by following tutorials:

- **Twitter Clone**: A full-stack application replicating core Twitter functionalities.
  - Project directory: [`MERN-course/twitter-clone/`](MERN-course/twitter-clone/)
- **Simple E-commerce Website**: A basic e-commerce platform demonstrating product listings
  - Project directory: [`React-course/simple_ecommerce/`](React-course/simple_ecommerce/)
- **Notes App**: A simple application for creating and managing notes.
  - Project directory: [`MERN-course/notesApp/`](MERN-course/notesApp/)
- **To-Do App**: A MERN stack implementation of a To-Do list application.
  - Project directory: [`MERN-course/to-do_app/`](MERN-course/to-do_app/)

## Other Projects

- **CLI-based Gemini Chatbot**: A command-line interface chatbot integrated with a `todo.py` script for task management.
  - Project directory: [`geminiChatBot/`](geminiChatBot/)
- **React Projects**: Various projects built while learning React.js, including:
  - Netflix UI Clone: [`React-course/Netflix_UI/`](React-course/Netflix_UI/)
  - Notes App: [`React-course/notes-app/`](React-course/notes-app/)
  - React Router Demo: [`React-course/react-router-demo/`](React-course/react-router-demo/)
  - ToDoList: [`React-course/toDoList/`](React-course/toDoList/)
- **Python Projects**:
  - `beautifulSoup/`
  - `REST_API/`
  - `selenium/`
  - `Social_media_app/` 
  - `TicTacToe/`
  - `ToDoList/` 
  - `veo/`
